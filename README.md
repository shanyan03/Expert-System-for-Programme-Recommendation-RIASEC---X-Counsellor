  Questionnaire, scoring per R/I/A/S/E/C, tie-break logic, rule base, and final programme suggestions.

## Highlights
- Transparent, **rule-based** logic (no black-box ML): easy to audit and extend
- **Validated questionnaire** that scores each RIASEC trait and handles ties with short follow-ups
- **Knowledge base** mapping dominant RIASEC codes (e.g., RIA, ISE) to degree options with brief rationales
- Clear, readable outputs: final 3-letter code + programme list students can act on
